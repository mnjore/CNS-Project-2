#  A Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System Using XGBoost
# Overview
This project aims to develop a Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) by combining machine learning techniques to enhance the detection of network intrusions. The system leverages both traditional rule-based and machine learning-based approaches to provide a more robust mechanism for identifying malicious network activities.
## Technologies Used
- VirtualBox
- Kali
- Python
- VSCode
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook
- hping
- arpspoof
- slowhttptest
## Installation
To install the IDS, follow these steps:
1. Install Python version 3.8 or later.

2. Install the required python packages:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the Hybrid IDS run the following command, replacing the file path for the rules.txt file:

```
$ python3 IDS.py -f "C:\Users\LENOVO\OneDrive\Documents\U\4\CNS Project 2\Intrusion-Detection-System-main\Intrusion-Detection-System-main\IDS_Final\SIDS\rules.txt"
```

## Acknowledgments
I would like to start by expressing my sincere gratitude to everyone who has contributed to the success of this project. First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the supervisor, Dr. Rop, for his advice, support and knowledge throughout the project. The direction and amount of this work were greatly influenced by Mr. Tabulu, the project lecturer with his insightful comments and helpful critiques. He also provided me with important tools and supporting scientific material that helped in the research and documentation process. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to my family and friends for their constant support and inspiration.  Finally, we would like to thank the open source community for providing the essential tools and software.
