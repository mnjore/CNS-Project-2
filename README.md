#  A Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System Using XGBoost
# Overview
This project aims to develop a Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) by combining machine learning techniques to enhance the detection of network intrusions. The system leverages both traditional rule-based and machine learning-based approaches to provide a more robust mechanism for identifying malicious network activities.
## Technologies Used
- VirtualBox
- Kali
- Python
- VSCode
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook
- hping
- arpspoof
- slowhttptest
## Installation
To install the IDS, follow these steps:
1. Install Python version 3.8 or later.

2. Install the required python packages:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the Hybrid IDS run the following command, replacing the file path for the rules.txt file:

```
$ python3 IDS.py -f "C:\Users\LENOVO\OneDrive\Documents\U\4\CNS Project 2\Intrusion-Detection-System-main\Intrusion-Detection-System-main\IDS_Final\SIDS\rules.txt"
```
